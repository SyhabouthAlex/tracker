# tracker
Personal project that I use to track various things and send updates to me via a Discord bot.

Currently I use it to track deals on /r/buildapcsales and streams on Twitch. The program sends an API request every 60 seconds
to Reddit and Twitch and messages me when there's a new deal that fits the criteria I'm looking for in the title or when there's
a Twitch stream that I'm tracking goes live.
